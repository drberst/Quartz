For chapter 9 the main thing I wanted to focus on was trying to set up a dataset that was web connected. One that could be refreshed, either manually or on a schedule. 

Gasoline prices have been high recently, so I searched for daily gasoline prices and ended up using an API at https://collectapi.com/api/gasPrice/. I had to do a bit of reading online, but I figured out how to have Power Bi pull data from the API. 

Once I did that, it was as easy as hitting refresh. 

Had some trouble with publishing, but it's okay. Couldn't refresh online. Error messages. Premium features

I was able to get daily gasoline (and diesel) prices for each state, and for a select few Michigan cities.
