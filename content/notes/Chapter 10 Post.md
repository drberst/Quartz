Basically redoing things from previous chapters in Excel / Power Pivot/ whatever
I think for the post I'll start by seeing if there's a previous work I can redo in Excel
Or it might be better just to use my own csv file 
but we aren't doing any kind of graph or chart until next chapter 
So it would seem like a bit of a waste to set everything up.
I'm not sure

Reading some of the other forums, I really don't need to do much. 
Just find a data source. And do stuff in excel. Do maybe one measure, calculation, chart, etc 
It should be easy. 
Just put in an hour or so, and it'll probably be close to done. 
Then I need to confront VCA stuff :\

Going to redo checking/credit data, imported into excel

1. opened csv
2. load data: change titles
3. remove columns
4. change type

Todo: 
1. create calendar table
2. link/merge checking/credit
